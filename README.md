# Rooftop Solar Panel Detection using Deep Learning
## Overview
The detection of solar panels through imagery-based algorithms has become increasingly crucial due to the significant growth of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in the energy market. One primary motivation for advancing solar panel detection technologies is the need to create granular datasets that capture detailed information about the location and power capacities of solar installations. This data is essential for optimizing energy production, managing grid systems, and informing urban planning decisions.

In this project, we develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect rooftop solar panels from images. We preprocess the data, train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance using various evaluation metrics. Additionally, we utilize the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Area Under the Curve (AUC) score to assess the model's performance.

# Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: We preprocess the dataset to extract relevant features and labels for training the CNN model. This involves resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the images to enhance the model's ability to generalize.

2. Model Development: We design and train a CNN model using TensorFlow or PyTorch libraries. The architecture of the CNN typically consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, and activation functions such as ReLU. We fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.

3. Model Evaluation: We evaluate the trained CNN model using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help us assess the model's ability to correctly identify rooftop solar panels.

4. ROC-AUC Analysis: We construct the ROC curve by plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at different threshold values. We calculate the AUC score to quantify the model's discrimination ability. A higher AUC value closer to 1 indicates better model performance.
